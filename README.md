## GBAHacks

This repo contains various experiments of mine for interacting with the
GameBoy Advance with tinygo.

This was mostly born out of the lack of examples provided with tinygo
itself for the GBA at the time of this repo's creation.


### Building

To build any of the examples, make sure tinygo is isntalled and configured first.
Then cd in to the sub folder and run `make gbahack.gba` to create a rom.
